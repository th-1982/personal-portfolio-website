# Surface
My aim was to create a visually pleasing and stylish design for my portfolio website, so I carefully selected color schemes and fonts that would complement each other. The surface design will enhance the overall look of my website, making it more appealing to visitors.

## Color Scheme
Combining a dark background with a vibrant accent color in the color scheme results in a modern and stylish design for the personal portfolio website. The color scheme of the portfolio website was designed using coolers.co.
